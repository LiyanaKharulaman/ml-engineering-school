## Section 1: Basic Git Commands


We will also provide references to interactive tutorials to help you practice these concepts.

### Creating a Branch

A branch in Git allows you to work on a separate line of development. To create a new branch, use the following command:
```bash
git branch <branch-name>
```

For example, to create a branch named `feature-branch`, you would run:
```bash
git branch feature-branch
```

> [!NOTE]
> To create a new branch and switch to it at the same time, use the `-b` flag:
> ```bash
> git checkout -b <branch-name>
> ```


### Checking Out a Branch

To switch to a different branch, use the `checkout` command:

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

### Adding and Committing Changes

After making changes to your files, you need to add them to the staging area and then commit them to the repository.


First, we'll check the status of the repository. This command shows the files that have been modified, added, or deleted and if they're staged for commit:

```bash
git status
```

To add changes to the staging area:

```bash
git add <file-name>
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To add all changes, use `git add .`.
> This is not recommended as it may add unwanted files to the staging area.
> Instead, use `git add <file-name>` to add specific files.
> If you want to add specifics chunks of a file, use `git add --patch .`. This will open an interactive mode where you can select the chunks you want to add using the keyboard.

To commit the changes with a message:

```bash
git commit -m "Commit message"
```

### Pushing Changes to a Remote Repository

Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or a network (GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, ...). They allow multiple people to collaborate on the same project from different locations.

To view the remote repositories associated with your local repository, you can use the following command:
```bash
git remote -v
```

To share your changes with others, you need to push them to a remote repository. Use the following command:

```bash
git push origin <branch-name>
```

For example, to push changes from `feature-branch`:

```bash
git push origin feature-branch
```

Sometimes, the remote branch does not exist yet. In this case, you can create the remote branch by adding the `-u` flag or `--set-upstream` option:

```bash
git push -u origin <branch-name>
```

### Making a Pull Request (PR)

A pull request allows you to notify others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. To create a pull request:
<!-- # TODO : Add a link to the GitHub documentation for creating a pull request. -->
<!-- # TODO : Add images -->

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click on the "Pull requests" tab.
3. Click the "New pull request" button.
4. Select the branch you want to merge into the base branch.
5. Click "Create pull request" and provide a description of your changes.

### Merging Branches

#### Merging to the Main Branch

Once your pull request is reviewed and approved, you can merge your branch into the main branch. To merge a branch:

1. Go to your pull request on GitHub.
2. Click the "Merge pull request" button.
3. Confirm the merge.

> [!TIP]
> You have 3 different options to merge your branch:
> - **Create a merge commit**: This option creates a new commit in the main branch that combines the changes from your branch.
> - **Squash and merge**: RECOMMENDED - This option combines all the commits from your branch into a single commit in the main branch.
> - **Rebase and merge**: DISCOURAGED - This option applies the changes from your branch on top of the main branch, creating a linear history. This is heavily discouraged as it can lead to conflicts and loss of information.


### Wrap Up

In this module, we covered the basics of Git, including creating branches, committing changes, pushing to remote repositories, and making pull requests. We also discussed merging strategies and best practices for maintaining a clean and efficient Git history.

For a visual representation of a typical Git workflow, refer to the following diagram:

## Section 2: Ignoring Files with `.gitignore`

When working on a project, you may have files or directories that you don't want to include in your Git repository. To ignore these files, you can create a `.gitignore` file in the root directory of your repository.

### Steps to Create and Use a `.gitignore` File

1. **Create a `.gitignore` file**: In the root directory of your repository, create a file named `.gitignore`.
2. **Add file patterns**: Open the `.gitignore` file and add patterns for the files and directories you want to ignore. For example:
   ```
   # Ignore all .log files
   *.log

   # Ignore the node_modules directory
   node_modules/

   # Ignore all files in the temp directory
   temp/
   ```
3. **Commit the `.gitignore` file**: Add and commit the `.gitignore` file to your repository to ensure that it is tracked by Git.

### Common `.gitignore` Patterns

- **Operating system files**: Ignore files generated by your operating system, such as `.DS_Store` on macOS or `Thumbs.db` on Windows.
- **Dependency directories**: Ignore directories that contain dependencies, such as `node_modules` for Node.js projects or `vendor` for PHP projects.
- **Build output**: Ignore files and directories generated by your build process, such as `dist` or `build`.

For more detailed information on `.gitignore` syntax and patterns, refer to the [official Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore).


### The `.gitkeep` File

In some cases, you may want to include an empty directory in your Git repository. Git does not track empty directories by default. To include an empty directory, you can create a file named `.gitkeep` within the directory. This file acts as a placeholder, ensuring that the directory is included in the repository.


## Section 3: Git Branching Strategies

When working on a project with multiple developers, it's essential to have a clear branching strategy to manage your codebase effectively. Here is a general Git flow that includes best practices, branch conventions, and commit guidelines:

### Branches

In a typical Git flow, the following branches are commonly used:
- **main**: The main branch contains production-ready code.
- **develop**: The develop branch contains the latest development changes.
- **feature**: Feature branches are created from develop and are used to develop new features.
- **release**: Release branches are created from develop and are used to prepare for a new production release.
- **hotfix**: Hotfix branches are created from main and are used to quickly fix production issues.

### Git Best Practices

1. **Keep your branches short-lived**: Regularly merge your changes to avoid long-lived branches that can become difficult to manage.
2. **Rebase frequently**: Rebase your feature branch with the develop branch to keep it up-to-date and resolve conflicts early.
3. **Use pull requests**: Always use pull requests to merge changes. This allows for code review and ensures that the code meets the project's standards.
4. **Write meaningful commit messages**: Commit messages should be clear and descriptive to make it easier to understand the history of changes.

### Conventional Commits

Conventional Commits is a specification for adding human and machine-readable meaning to commit messages. Here are some common prefixes:
- **feat**: A new feature
- **fix**: A bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code changes that neither fix a bug nor add a feature
- **test**: Adding or updating tests
- **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Example commit message:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: add user authentication feature"
git commit -m "fix: resolve issue with login button"
git commit -m "docs: update README with installation instructions"
```
